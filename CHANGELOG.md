## 0.1.0

*   **Initial release.**

This is the first version of `pocketbase_drift`, a powerful offline-first client for the PocketBase backend, built on top of the reactive persistence library [Drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu).

### Features

*   **Offline-First Architecture**: Read, create, update, and delete records even without a network connection. The client seamlessly uses the local database as the source of truth.
*   **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes made while offline are automatically queued and retried when network connectivity is restored.
*   **Reactive Data & UI**: Build reactive user interfaces with streams that automatically update when underlying data changes, whether from a server push or a local mutation.
*   **Local Caching with Drift**: All collections and records are cached in a local SQLite database, providing fast, offline access to your data.
*   **Powerful Local Querying**: Full support for local querying, mirroring the PocketBase API. This includes:
    *   **Filtering**: Complex `filter` strings are parsed into SQLite `WHERE` clauses.
    *   **Sorting**: Sort results by any field with `sort` (e.g., `-created,name`).
    *   **Field Selection**: Limit the returned fields with `fields` for improved performance.
    *   **Pagination**: `limit` and `offset` are fully supported for local data.
*   **Relation Expansion**: Support for expanding single and multi-level relations (e.g., `post.author`) directly from the local cache.
*   **Full-Text Search**: Integrated Full-Text Search (FTS5) for performing fast, local searches across all your cached record data.
*   **Authentication Persistence**: User and admin authentication state is persisted locally using `shared_preferences`, keeping users logged in across app sessions.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Works across all Flutter-supported platforms, including mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux).
*   **Basic File & Image Caching**: Includes a `PocketBaseImageProvider` that caches images in the local database for offline display.
